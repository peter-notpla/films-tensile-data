## What this project is

The Notpla lab data pipeline. Test results from lab instruments flow into
BigQuery and a Looker Studio dashboard.

```
Mecmesin tensile tester (VectorPro)
  -> CSV export
  -> manual check folder on a Windows PC (files are opened in Excel here)
  -> Windows Task Scheduler uploads to GCS every ~10 minutes
  -> Eventarc fires a Cloud Function per test type
  -> BigQuery table per test type
  -> Looker Studio, one page per test type
```

GCP project `notpla-machine-data`, region `europe-west2`.

## Working style

- **One clear ask per response.** Do not stack multiple tasks.
- **Succinct.** Brief answers, brief questions.
- **Full-file replacements** over "find this line" edits wherever practical.
- **Dry run before anything destructive.** Snapshot BigQuery tables before writes.
- **Never use em-dashes or en-dashes.** Use a hyphen, comma, semicolon or colon.
- **Avoid AI-tell sentence patterns**, specifically "Statement. Now the negated
  framing, then a snappy closing clause" and "Not A, not B. Just C."
- Peter finds BigQuery unintuitive to query directly and prefers Looker.
- Explain roadblocks clearly when they happen.

## Specimen key model

Settled 20 August 2026 after testing every alternative against the full history.

| Purpose | Fields |
|---|---|
| Identity | `machine_id`, `test_type`, `timestamp_minute`, `sample` |
| Provenance | `template_name` (row 1 of the CSV), `source_file`, full `timestamp_start` |
| Analysis | `pellet_id`, `extrusion_id`, `test_direction` |

`timestamp_minute + sample` produced 2,990 distinct keys with zero conflations.
Alternatives were rejected on evidence: `timestamp + stress + modulus` had 1
conflation, and adding `pellet_id` fragmented identity because it is a mutable
field that gets corrected by hand.

**Minute resolution is deliberate.** See the Excel section below.

---

## Things that are true and non-obvious

### Sample numbers are not stable identifiers

VectorPro assigns sample numbers per test template. Copying a template, which
is required for any major edit, restarts the counter at 1. Two manual Excel
backfills then rewrote them differently: tensile was **resequenced** from
1,000,000, friction was **offset** by exactly +1,000,000. Neither is recorded
anywhere.

This is why an early reconciliation reported 1,020 missing specimens when the
true figure was 52. Never key on sample number alone.

### Excel destroys precision, and this is accepted

The manual check step involves opening files in Excel and saving. Excel:
- drops seconds from timestamps (`09:54:00` becomes `09:54`)
- strips trailing zeros from numbers (`0.810` becomes `0.81`)
- pads row 1 with trailing commas

Peter has decided to keep this workflow. Any key must tolerate minute
resolution, and any comparison of measurements must be **numeric, never
string**.

Detection signatures for flagging: row 1 ending in comma padding, or every
timestamp in a file having zero seconds.

### ID formats

- `pellet_id`: `^[A-Z]{2} [A-Z]{2} [A-Z]{2} [A-Z]{2} [0-9]{6} [A-Z]{2} [A-Z]{2} [0-9]{4}$`
- `extrusion_id`: `^[A-Z]{2} [0-9]{6} [A-Z]{2} [0-9]{4}$`

**Flag, do not reject.** A hard gate would have discarded roughly 150
legitimate rows from a one-off packaging study to catch 25 typos.

Trim whitespace silently. It carries no information and is invisible in every UI.

### Friction has two static CoF columns by design

VectorPro's peak function sometimes fails to detect static CoF, so
`backup_static_cof` was added as a fallback. Older files lack it. Precedence:
use static where present, fall back to backup, record which was used.

## Tool traps that have caused silent failures here

Every one of these processed less than it was given and said nothing.

1. `gsutil -m cp -I` drops most of stdin. Use wildcard copy and prune locally.
2. `comm` needs matching sort order. Use `LC_ALL=C sort` on both sides.
3. `while read` drops the last line if there is no trailing newline.
4. gsutil treats `[` `]` as wildcards. `[WIP]` matches W, I or P. Use `?`.
5. `rows`, `range` and `groups` are reserved words in BigQuery. Alias as `n_rows`.
6. `bq query` defaults to 100 rows. Always set `--max_rows`.
7. `bq` returns non-JSON output for DDL and DML. Parse defensively.
8. Pasting heredocs into a terminal mangles them.
9. A failed `git push` caused three months of undetected repo divergence.

**Assert expected counts at every step.** Do not trust that a loop consumed
everything or that a query returned everything.

## Repository layout

```
pipelines/films-tensile-csv-processor/     deployed, fixed 14 May 2026
pipelines/films-friction-csv-processor/    deployed, all-STRING schema
pipelines/films-extrusion-csv-processor/   deployed, fixed 21 Aug 2026
pipelines/films-friction-raw-processor/    NOT deployed
backfill/                                  one-off scripts, legacy
```

As of 21 August 2026 the repo matches what is deployed. Keep it that way:
commit and push in the same session as any deploy.

---

## Deploy and verify

```bash
cd ~/films-tensile-data/pipelines/<pipeline>
python3 -m py_compile main.py && echo "compiles clean"
gcloud functions deploy <function-name> --region=europe-west2 --gen2 --source=. --quiet
```

Always verify a deploy took effect by checking the logs for a distinctive
string from the new code, not by assuming.

## Live alerting

Extrusion only, as at 21 August 2026:

- Log line `EXTRUSION_PIPELINE_FAILURE`
- Metric `extrusion_pipeline_failure`
- Channel `projects/notpla-machine-data/notificationChannels/14063382024575468776`
- Policy `projects/notpla-machine-data/alertPolicies/16570272964582018556`
- `autoClose: 86400s`, so failures self-close after 24 hours regardless

Wider alerting is Phase 1 work. Extrusion errors always route to
peter@notpla.com.

---

## Current state

Phase 0 of `pipeline-roadmap.md` is complete. Phase 1 is next: manifest table,
row-errors table, hourly first-sighting alert, Friday digest, Looker health page.

All failed-processing folders are empty. Anything appearing in them is a live
problem.

Genuine backlogs, deliberately untouched:
- 738 friction raw files failed, no processor deployed
- 197 friction raw files queued
- 1,244 tensile raw sample files, no processor watches that prefix

**Bucket versioning is Suspended. Any delete is permanent.**

---

## Open item

Samples 1383 to 1392 exist twice with two roll codes. Evidence favours
`...PF 1264 / AO 260701 LR 1379`. Awaiting confirmation from whoever ran the
test before the ten `1279`-labelled rows are deleted.
